  **This is a Feature Request**

  Translate this page [FILE_TARGET](HYPERLINK) into Spanish.


  **What would you like to be added**

  The translation will be added to `content/es/`FILE_TARGET


  **Why is this needed**

  There is no Spanish localization for this file.
  It would be great if we could read this in Spanish.


  **Comments**

  The Spanish translation team would like to facilitate your contribution's journey, 
  any doubt participate in the weekly meetings in the kubernetes slack channel `kubernetes-docs-es`


  We also encourage new contributors to participate in their native speaking language ðŸ’¥.
